# Smartphones Credit Exercise

This is a page that shows three fake smartphones with a certain amount of credit on them.

You can add more credit as well as pretend to perform a phone call by specifying how many minutes the phone call will last. This will change the remaining credit amount.

I made this as an exercise for my EPICODE classes.
